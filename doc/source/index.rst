Welcome to Eve W-Space 0.2!
===========================

NOTE: Eve W-Space is currently in alpha. Most features outside of Mapping 
are not yet implemented past some prototype data models. 

What is it?
-----------
Eve W-Space is, at its core, a wormhole mapping and intel tool for the MMORPG 
Eve Online. If you wish, it can be much more. It can be customized to fill 
roles from simple mapping applicaiton (with all extra features disabled) to  
the centerpiece of an entire alliance services infrastructure.

Eve W-Space is designed to be a single-tenant soulution hosted by a single corp 
or alliance. A fleixble permissions system allows for easily restricting data 
where needed.
